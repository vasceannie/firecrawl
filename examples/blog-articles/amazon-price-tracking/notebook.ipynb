    "\n",
    "1. New imports and setup\n",
    "   - Added `asyncio` for `async`/`await` support\n",
    "   - Imported `send_price_alert` from `notifications.py`\n",
    "   - Defined `PRICE_DROP_THRESHOLD = 0.05` (5% threshold for alerts)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Async function conversion\n",
    "   - Converted `check_prices()` to async function\n",
    "   - Gets unique product URLs using set comprehension to avoid duplicates\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Price history analysis\n",
    "   - Retrieves full price history for each product\n",
    "   - Gets `earliest_price` from `history[-1]` (works because we ordered by timestamp DESC)\n",
    "   - Skips products with no price history using `continue`\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Price drop detection logic\n",
    "   - Calculates drop percentage: `(earliest_price - current_price) / earliest_price`\n",
    "   - Checks if drop exceeds 5% threshold\n",
    "   - Sends Discord alert if threshold exceeded using `await send_price_alert()`\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Async main block\n",
    "   - Uses `asyncio.run()` to execute async `check_prices()` in event loop\n"

    "Congratulations for making it to the end of this extremely long tutorial! We've just covered how to implement an end-to-end Python project you can proudly showcase on your portfolio. We built a complete price tracking system that scrapes product data from e-commerce websites, stores it in a Postgres database, analyzes price histories, and sends automated Discord notifications when prices drop significantly. Along the way, we learned about web scraping with Firecrawl, database management with SQLAlchemy, asynchronous programming with asyncio, building interactive UIs with Streamlit, automating with GitHub actions and integrating external webhooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the project is far from perfect. Since we took a top-down approach to building this app, our project code is scattered across multiple files and doesn't conform to programming best practices most of the time. For this reason, I've recreated the same project in a much more sophisticated matter with production-level features. [This new version on GitHub](https://github.com/BexTuychiev/automated-price-tracking) implements proper database session management, faster operations and overall smoother user experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to stick with the basic version, you can find the full project code and the notebook from the official Firecrawl GitHub repository example projects. I also recommend that you deploy your Streamlit app to Streamlit Cloud so that you have a function app accessible everywhere you go. \n",
